# A-Search-on-a-Real-Road-Network-with-a-Modified-Heuristic

The experiment uses a modified heuristic for A* search on a real road network. This road
network was the city of Minneapolis. The original heuristic for this problem calculated the
distance traveled plus the straight line distance to the goal. It was found that a modified
heuristic which considers left and right turns can greatly reduce the number of turns taken
with only a slight increase in total distance. Other research on this topic was discussed and
considered in the design of the experiment. Future modifications of this work would include
testing the effects of other heuristics. These other heuristics may include traffic, weather and
construction. Overall, it was learned that a modified heuristic on A* search can provide one
with valuable results.
